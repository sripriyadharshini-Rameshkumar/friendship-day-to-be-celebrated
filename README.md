This day mean a lot to all,👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩not one or two when I mean all its about everyone who could breath💫. Even One who could breath could not live without a friend⚡. One could have many friends but if they don't have their right person next to them they are nothing💕. 

 Today I feel recreated when I see my people texting me happy friendship day❤️. They mean the world to me. This may sound a bit enormous but I mean it entirely💟. U r my sunshine☀️. When I ask for a wish, and also for u to accomplish those. 🥰

Nothing is durable, but u guys are. Memories we shared, love u all showered with,days we spent....🌸

Areewaah couldn't type. School days are heaven,🥀 undoubtedly yes and school friends are gracious🐒. 

U people are fundamental, u people are compulsory💯. How a friend could be so lovely❣️ how a friend could be so horrible🧡 how a friend could be acceptable🔅. A friend play all roles in a individual's life.👩👨
 *For me* 

 *_God found a tenure 'friend' to make my life effortless when I have u next to me.🎃U were always there to lend me ur shoulders and wipe my tears and make me giggle👑._* 

We discern no bar of caste, religion, social status anything, because we come under the phrase, a very meaningful phrase friendship😁.

 *U love me and I do to you. I care for u and u care for me. 💓* 

God is so kind by providing u as my very own🤍. I love my friends for what they are and I don't complain, rather I would change them if required, but I will never stop loving them💟


 _U made me what I am today. We consumed our days in school the maximum, I mean it from my kindergarten to my intermediate classes,all my memories revolve around u without justification🚫. We don't possess partiality and we don't care about people who criticize us. (By the way they could only be our classmates not friends)._ 

We spent our days till primary classes without knowing basics of friendship🙈 even though not now, but the love we had during our primary classes didn't change for now. 


 *We guys are the most outlandish for the conversations we had🙈and the games we played.We shared everything that one could.* 

We fought , we cried but now we simply smile remembering those😅. Yayy friends are additionally more than anything and everything. ♥️

 _Now I write this to wish my best and loved ones a very happy friendship day.😘_ 

These statements and the feelings it encompasses won't change even if I wish u a very happy friendship day after 50years.👩‍🦳
 I am not able to figure out everything here.But I loved u and I would continue to do it for the rest of my existence. 
U need not to be the best always we can become the worst together.

உடுக்கை இழந்தவன் கைபோலே ஆங்கே இடுக்கண் களைவதாம் நட்பு.
Love,
